# iOS Client Source Structure

This directory contains organized code structure for the future iOS native application development.

## Directory Purpose

- **components/**: SwiftUI view components and reusable UI elements
- **services/**: iOS services (notifications, photo capture, API integration)  
- **stores/**: State management and data flow (ObservableObject classes)
- **types/**: Swift model definitions and data structures
- **utils/**: Utility functions and extensions for iOS development

## Next Steps

When creating the Xcode project, this structure can serve as a reference for organizing the Swift/SwiftUI codebase following the architecture defined in `/ios-planning/`.

The actual iOS implementation will be in an Xcode project with .swift files, but this structure provides a roadmap for the development team.
